Project: PDF Document Analysis with PyMuPDF
This project demonstrates how to use Python to extract metadata and locate key sections in scientific or technical PDFs using the PyMuPDF library.
Using PyMuPDF, I was able to programmatically locate important sections in a PDF, which can be useful for summarizing academic papers, extracting data, or automating documentation review.
